# Exploratory Data Analysis WebApp

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) WebApp** is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to quickly analyze datasets (CSV or Excel) and generate detailed profiling reports.  
It leverages **pandas**, **ydata-profiling**, and **seaborn** to automate data exploration and visualization — no coding required.  

Users can upload their own dataset or use a sample dataset to instantly view descriptive statistics, missing values, correlations, and distribution plots.
